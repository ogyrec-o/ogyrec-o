I'm building **[Freven](https://discord.gg/jNzCBNSMyW)** - a voxel sandbox + moddable platform with its own engine.
Server-authoritative simulation, transport-swappable multiplayer (QUIC / inproc), and data-driven content where **"Experiences" (modes)** are first-class.

## Focus
- **Engine & runtime** - voxel rendering/meshing, performance, clean layering, networking
- **Content & modding foundations** - packs/registries/manifests, stable interfaces, code mods
- **ML systems** - NEAT (incl. realtime variants), RL, LLM experiments & tooling
- **Audio** - composition for games
- and more
